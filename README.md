## About

A console application that implements the game [Wheel of Fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_of_Fortune_(American_game_show)).

## MVP Goals

1. Supports one player 

2. Choose a string 

    - Hardcoded is fine 

    - Display dashes for missing letters 

3. Allow current player to guess letters 

    - If letter is in the word, replace underscores with matching letters 

    - If letter is not in word, let play know and keep playing. 

4. Allow current player to solve 

    - If guess is correct (not case sensitive), player wins 

    - If guess is not correct, keep playing 



##  Future Product Roadmap
1. Add multiple players feature into game session

2. Add points system that would count points for each correct guess per player

3. Add competitive mode which would allow player to loose.

## Bugs 
TBD
